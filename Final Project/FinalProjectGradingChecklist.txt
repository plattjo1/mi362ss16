300 – 4 complete HTML pages with these pages Home, About Me, Experience, and Contact Me

200 – Custom CSS + Bootstrap elements to format and make my website look good. I've used Bootstrap before so rapidly iterating with it is always nice.

50 – 2 custom photos of myself, 1 on the home page and 1 on the about me page. I always sort of created the background from an existing image so I'm not sure if that counts. Eitherway, those two photos are original.

50 –  Javascript component – Using Bootstrap I made a small carousel with javascript, gave every photo a caption and set the interval time to change pictures by itself every 7.5 seconds

50 – Used 3rd Party Font Icon FontAwesome. I used a phone and email font icon for my contact me page

50  – Used a 3rd widget from Addthis to create a small social media tab on the left side of every page that every user can close if they want.
